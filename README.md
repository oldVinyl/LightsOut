**RUN THE " MAIN.JAVA " FILE**

- Like in Formula 1, there are 5 lights that come on in turn with a preset delay between, you can mess with those numbers in the main.java file
- The lights actually go out one by one but you dont see that
- All the lights go off and its LIGHTS OUT!
- At lights out, the nanotime at the moment is recorded, and youre prompted to press spacebar
- When you press spacebar, the nanotime at that moment is also recorded and their difference is recorded in milliseconds and displayed.
- The java.swing window is there for aesthetics tbh- actually, its just so i can record the key presses bc i was struggling with the scanner (pathetic, yes, i know :[)
- but maybe one day ill add graphics so you actually see the lights go out, who knows?

  So, do you think you are faster than Lando Norris or even Max Verstappen?
  Wanna find out?

This is a personal little something that has been on my mind for quite some time and we are learning OOP in school so i thought, 'heck! why not!'
(also, the f1 winter break is too long and withdrawal's got me out here feeling like day-old toast)
